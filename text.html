				<h3>3. Bitcoins are provided with CPU time.</h3>
				<p>It's incorrectly to say that bitcoins are provided with central processing unit time. When they say that currency is 'provided with' something, it is considered to be centrally tied to something by its exchange rate. You can't exchange bitcoins for computing power expended for its generation (it is too high). Bitcoins are provided with nothing in this sense. This is a self-valuable product.</p>
				<p>Think about it: is gold provided with something? No, it isn't, it's just gold. The same thing concerns bitcoins.</p>
				<p>Bitcoin currency was created using CPU power. Integrity of blockchains is protected from different attacks by wide computer <br>network existence. That's it.</p>

			<div class="article__paragraph">
				<h3>4. Bitcoins are worthless as they are provided with nothing.</h3>
				<p>Gold is provided with nothing, but it is used and valued worldwide. See previous myth.</p>
